* Main Goals
** Prove that ~insertion_sort~ doesn't execute more than n ^ 2 comparisons
** Prove that ~merge_sort~ doesn't execute more than n * log(n) comparisons

* Use a [[https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia#Monad][Monad]] to keep count of comparisons ([[https://www.twanvl.nl/blog/agda/sorting][Tutorial]])
** Why are the two definitions of sorted equivalent in the tutorial? (Answered)
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
-- Sorted permutations of a list
data Sorted : List A → Set  where
  []   : Sorted []
  cons : ∀ x {xs xxs}
       → (p : x ◂ xs ≡ xxs) -- inserting x somewhere into xs gives xxs
       → (least : x ≤* xs)  -- x is the smallest element of the list
       → (rest : Sorted xs) -- and we have also sorted xs
       → Sorted xxs

record Sorted' (xs : List A) : Set where
  field
    ys       : List A
    isSorted : IsSorted ys
    isPerm   : IsPermutation ys xs
#+END_SRC

These two are equivalent: the first one first deconstruct the list, with its smallest element. It is
implicitly asserting that x :: xs is xxs sorted

** How it works (what I've understand)
First, define a dependent type "in-time", that takes a type (in our case would be "Sorted (sort xs)")
and a natural n. A term of type "A in-time n" is a proof that A is constructed in at most n steps.
Here is how the tutorial implements this and how I translated to Lean:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data _in-time_ {a} (A : Set a) (n : ℕ) : Set a where
    box : A → A in-time n
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
inductive inTime : Prop → ℕ → Prop
| box {α : Prop} {n : ℕ} : inTime α n
#+END_SRC

This "box" constructor could be a proof that any computation has any running time, but it should be private.
The author of the tutorial defines that comparing two elements takes 1 step:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
_≤?_ : (x y : A) → (x ≤ y ⊎ y ≤ x) in-time 1
#+END_SRC
Which I translated to:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
axiom compare : ∀ {α : Type} [has_le α] {x y : α},
  inTime (x ≤ y \/ y ≤ x) 1
#+END_SRC

Also, he defines the monad operators to be able to compose two computations, by summing their running times:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
_>>=_ : ∀ {a b} {A : Set a} {B : Set b} → {n m : ℕ} → A in-time n → (A → B in-time m) → B in-time (n + m)
#+END_SRC

I didn't translated it to Lean yet. The idea seems to construct the sorting function using this new operators.
This way, the type of the sorting function will already state the running time it takes. In the example of the
tutorial, we have something like:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  insertion-sort : (xs : List A) → Sorted xs in-time length xs ^ 2
#+END_SRC

Where Sorted is the dependent type he defined to represent a sorted list. Mathlib takes another approach to
prove the correctness of sorting. Instead of embedding this in the type of the function, it first defines the
function and then, separately proves that it satisfies some property. We have something like:

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
def insertion_sort : list α → list α
#+END_SRC

And, somewhere else:

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
theorem sorted_insertion_sort : ∀ l, sorted r (insertion_sort r l)
#+END_SRC

To prove statements about running type, I will have to adapt the technique of the tutorial to this style.
I think the way to go would be to have the following theorem:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
theorem rt_insertion_sort : ∀ l, inTime (sorted r (insertion_sort r l)) (l.length * l.length)
#+END_SRC

Or, perhaps, another possibility would be to modify the type inTime to take a function as first
argument and prove something like
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
theorem rt_insertion_sort : ∀ l, inTime' (insertion_sort r l) (l.length * l.length)
#+END_SRC

In fact, I don't know if any of this is possible without modifying insertion-sort to keep counting the
comparisons using the monad operators... I'll have to think more about it.

Questions (to Haniel)
- If it turns out to be impossible to adapt the technique, would it be okay to write another version
  of insertion sort and merge sort? I don't know if this is what was said in the Zulip post I've made,
  if they meant to rewrite the functions to add the bookkeeping.
- Sometimes it seems that this tutorial is "cheating"... for example, it says that
  "box" constructor is private, but to prove the base case of insertion-sort (in [[https://gist.github.com/twanvl/5635740][this]] file, line 392)
  he uses "return", which translates directly into "box"... so we can't just prove anything about
  running times using return? :P
** Rewriting the functions
It turns out I will have to rewrite the functions so they can bookkeep the number of
comparisons made on their type, as people from Zulip have said. I think it's enough
to implement, for example Insertion Sort with type =List \alpha -> (List \alpha \times Nat)=, where
=Nat= is a natural representing the number of operations made. This is the first implementation,
I will also implement this property as a dependent type, and insertion sort
as a function from lists to this dependent type (like the tutorial). Also,
for both implementations I would like to prove that they yield the same list as
the algorithms from mathlib, so I can use their proof of correctness for sorting
to prove that my algorithm is also correct.

* First Implementation
Seems a little imprecise... maybe the second approach gives a higher guarantee that we're
counting correctly. Also, I don't know how to make the proof if I use "let" in
ordered_insert, in the goal something like =ordered_insert.match b= will appear and
I don't know how to deal with that... Extracting a function that has =simp=
makes the proof very easy.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean

@[simp] def go (b : α) (l : list α × ℕ) : (list α × ℕ) := (b :: l.fst, l.snd + 1)

-- the second value in the output is the number of comparisons made
@[simp] def ordered_insert (a : α) : list α → (list α × ℕ)
| [] := ([a], 0)
| (b :: l) := if a ≼ b then (a :: b :: l, 1)
                       else go b (ordered_insert l)
                       -- else let (l', n) := ordered_insert l in (b :: l', n + 1)

theorem ordered_insert_linear (a : α) : ∀ l : list α, (ordered_insert r a l).snd ≤ l.length
| [] := by simp
| (b :: l) :=
begin
  simp,
  split_ifs,
  { simp, },
  { have ih : (ordered_insert r a l).snd + 1 ≤ l.length + 1 := nat.pred_le_iff.mp (ordered_insert_linear l),
    refine le_trans _ ih,
    refine eq.ge _,
    exact rfl,
  }
end
